# TSBALLS

simulating [gophrics](https://github.com/sofaspawn/gophrics) in typescript for the web.

## TODO:
- [x] create canvas
- [x] display ball
- [x] make the ball move
- [x] bound check the ball
- [x] add keyboard controls
- [ ] spawn some obstacles to dodge or make some kinda cool math animation

## Learning:
- it was way easier to implement [gophrics](https://github.com/sofaspawn/gophrics) in typescript.
- the browser is just a better place to do such small level stuff
- anyways, this project helped me break ice and gave me the push to start working on my rusty typescript knowledge
